The cleanbot software is an Arduino project i'm writing for my final paper at school.

Future things to be added include:
- ~~An algorithim to stop the robot from crashing into the wall~~
- ~~Being able to detect and avoid abstacles~~
- ~~More advanced debug mode~~
- ~~Added second front-sensor~~
- Clean as much space as possible
- Put evetything in a nice library

Everything will be written in the default Arduino IDE using c++
